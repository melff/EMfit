Description: The package contains the boilerplate code for estimating latent variable
   models by maximum marginal likelihood using EM algorithms. The code is generic and thus
   not optimised for particular models. The package supports fitting latent class or finite
   mixture models using simple EM algorithms and (to some degree) latent trait or continous mixture models
   using Monte Carlo EM algorithms. Only importance sampling is supported for MCEM. However,
   it implements automatic sample size adjustment using the approach of Caffo Jank and Jones.
